Description:
    dataCleanr is designed for addressing common data management tasks 
    encountered when preparing data for archive and reuse. Many of these 
    functions were created by the Environmental Data Initiative's Data 
    Curation Team to accelerate their data curation efficiency, and we 
    welcome contributions from anyone.
